# Agrovision â€“ Crop Classification with AI

This project uses satellite data and a Transformer-based AI model to classify land as crop or non-crop. It uses the [OpenMapFlow](https://github.com/nasaharvest/openmapflow) framework with data from NASA's CropHarvest.

## Features:
- Uses real satellite data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2)
- Trains a binary classifier (crop vs non-crop)
- Easy to run and GitHub-ready
